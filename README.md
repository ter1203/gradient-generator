# React Color Gradient Project

## Project Overview

This React project focuses on creating and manipulating a dynamic color gradient. Users can add or remove colors to a gradient, which updates in real-time. The main feature of this project is its ability to remember the previous color configurations even when colors are removed, without the need for additional state management for deleted colors.

## Features

- **Dynamic Color Gradient:** Create a linear gradient using a dynamic array of colors.
- **Add/Remove Colors:** Users can add up to 5 colors or reduce them to a minimum of 2 in the gradient.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implemented without additional state for 'deletedColors'. This is achieved by controlling the number of visible colors, rather than deleting or adding new colors to the state.

## Implementation Details

- **useState for Colors and Visibility:** The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage the colors array and the number of visible colors.
- **Slicing for Visibility:** The visible colors are determined by slicing the colors array up to the number of `numOfVisibleColors`.
- **CSS Gradient Background:** The color gradient is displayed as a CSS linear gradient background, dynamically generated from the colors array.

I understand that some of you might be thinking, "I couldn't have thought of this myself," and you might feel a bit disheartened. It's perfectly normal to grasp the solution once it's explained but still feel unsure about your own ability to develop similar solutions independently.

Please let me reassure you: everyone starts somewhere, and I was in the same position not so long ago. My own journey involved a lot of trial and error, and often, I stumbled upon interesting patterns purely by chance. Over time, I learned to recognize and apply these patterns in new and creative ways. Remember, it's a learning process for all of us. ðŸ™‚
